Open-source ray tracing code in MATLAB/Octave. It is now relaunched with new features and a clear roadmap.

<b>Current Features:</b>
* API for easy use
* 3D ray tracing and display (vectorized, efficient plotting)
* Thick lenses with support for **aspherical surfaces** and spherical aberrations
* Off-axis components and ray bundles
* **Chromatic** Aberrations and Dispersion (beta)
* Mini-Material Library
* Improved 3D visualization with clearer surfaces and bundles
* Back Focal Length and Circle of Least Confusion calculation
* No toolboxes or non-core MATLAB/Octave packages required
* Simple example scripts
<br>


The code has been tested on Octave 5.2 and 10.2. It is theoretically compatible with MATLAB R2017+.
I have started it back in 2020. I am relaunching it now, because I believe it is based on solid algorthmic foundation.

## ðŸš§ Gaps (Not Yet Supported)
- Polarization effects  
- Interference / diffraction  
<br>

## ðŸ›  Roadmap
- Documentation
- Higher Level Api (lenses instead of surfaces)
- Popular Examples
- Free sensor placement (not limited to axis-aligned planes)
- GUI v0.1 (longitudinal layout with optional 3D pop-out)
- Improved lens visualization in 3D and 2D

<b>Code Preview:</b>

In designs folder: You define the scene file (optical components and Sensor) 

In Main.m: You define the ray source and the computation parameters
