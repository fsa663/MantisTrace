# RayTracing1

MATLAB Ray Tracing Code:

Main Features:
* 3D ray tracing and display
* Supports thick lenses and simulates spherical aberrations 
* Can simulate off-axis components

Main Drawbacks:
* Does not consider polarization
* Does not consider chromatic aberrations


Code Preview:
The user should mainly use files "Ex1.m" and "Main.m".
In Ex1.m : You define the optical components
In Main.m: You define the ray source and the computation parameters
