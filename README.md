# RayTracing1

MATLAB Ray Tracing Code:

Main Features:
* 3D ray tracing and display
* Supports thick lenses and simulates spherical aberrations 
* Can simulate off-axis components

The code currently does not support the following:
* polarization
* chromatic aberrations
* Interference

Code Preview:

The user should mainly use files "Ex1.m" and "Main.m".

In Ex1.m : You define the optical components

In Main.m: You define the ray source and the computation parameters
